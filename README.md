## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Gumloop.com is a sophisticated workflow automation platform designed to streamline business processes through visual workflow creation and execution. The platform follows a layered architecture pattern ensuring scalability, maintainability, and robust performance.

### System Architecture Layers:
1. **User Interface Layer** - REST/WebSocket APIs, Web Dashboard
2. **Workflow Engine** - Job queuing and task management
3. **Orchestration Layer** - Node-wise execution and state management
4. **Integration Layer** - Third-party service connections (Google, Slack, APIs)
5. **Persistence Layer** - PostgreSQL primary database with Redis for caching
6. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
